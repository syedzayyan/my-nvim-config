# My NeoVim Config

My Humble Neovim Config. I have tried keeping things lite. My journey into Neovim started with an irritation to constantly move to mouse, while it is a robust tool, I feel like it contributes to my RSI and stabbing wrist pain often and somehow being in a mouseless development environment helps with that or so I tell myself it seems. My development speed is certainly almost at the same level, but it feels like less distraction and a more "cleaner" workspace.

I use `packer.nvim` because ThePrimeAgen uses it and it perhaps feels a bit elegant compared to Lazy and I have an assortment of plugins and LSPs as I constantantly language hop. AI/ML person by the day with Python, a hardcore CompSci student by the afternoon in C and a hobbyist Haskeller and Web Dev by the night. As you can see I wear many hats and lately I have been coding on an HPC where Neovim is a big help.
